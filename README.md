# 🤖 Agent0

**A self-improving AI agent that lives in GitHub Actions**

Agent0 is an autonomous AI agent that runs entirely on GitHub Actions, communicates via Telegram, remembers every conversation in Git, and continuously learns and improves itself by writing code.

## 🌟 Features

- **🧠 Persistent Memory**: Every conversation stored in Git history
- **🔄 Self-Improving**: Analyzes performance and writes new skills
- **⏰ Asynchronous**: Responds every 5 minutes via GitHub Actions cron
- **💬 Telegram Bot**: Simple text-based interface
- **📝 Self-Aware**: Reads its own `soul.md` and understands its purpose
- **🚀 Serverless**: No servers to maintain, runs on GitHub Actions
- **🔧 PR Creation**: Create pull requests via bot for Copilot agent execution

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
User → Telegram → GitHub Actions (every 5 min) → Agent0 → Response
                         ↓
                    Git commits (memory)
```

```

## 🚀 Setup

### 1. Create Telegram Bot

1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram
2. Use `/newbot` command
3. Get your bot token

### 2. Add Secrets to GitHub

Go to your repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

Add these secrets:

- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` - Your bot token from BotFather
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - (Optional) Your Claude API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)

### 3. Enable GitHub Actions

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Enable workflows if prompted
3. The bot will start running automatically every 5 minutes

### 4. Test Your Bot

Send a message to your Telegram bot. Within 5 minutes (at the next cron run), the agent will:
1. Poll for your message
2. Load its soul and memory
3. Think and generate a response
4. Reply to you
5. Commit the conversation to Git

## 💬 Usage

Just message your bot on Telegram! Examples:

```
You: Hello!
Agent0: Hi! I'm Agent0, an AI agent running on GitHub Actions...

You: What can you do?
Agent0: I can have conversations and remember them forever in Git...

You: Do you remember what we talked about?
Agent0: Yes! Last time you asked me about...
```

### 🎯 Skills System

Agent0 has a modular skills system that automatically discovers and executes capabilities:

```
You: Use the help skill to learn about available commands
Agent0: Here are the available topics: skills, commands, setup...
```

Skills are organized in three categories:
- **Bundled** - Built-in skills (core, github, help)
- **Managed** - Installed from external sources
- **Workspace** - Custom skills for your project

See [skills/README.md](skills/README.md) for details on creating skills.

### 🔧 Creating PRs via Bot

You can ask Agent0 to create pull requests that will be executed by GitHub Copilot agents:

```
You: Create a PR to add a health check endpoint
Agent0: ✅ PR Created Successfully!
        PR: #123
        Branch: bot-task/add-a-health-check-endpoint-1234567890
        The PR is now ready for GitHub Copilot agents to work on.

You: Make a PR to fix authentication bug
Agent0: ✅ PR Created Successfully!
        ...
```

**Supported formats:**
- "create a PR to [task description]"
- "make a PR to [task description]"
- "create a pull request to [task description]"
- "can you create a PR to [task description]"
- "please create a PR to [task description]"

The bot will:
1. Parse your task request
2. Create a new branch
3. Create a pull request with detailed instructions
4. Label it for Copilot agent execution
5. Return the PR link to you

## 🧠 How Memory Works

Every conversation is stored in:
- `memory/conversations/YYYY-MM/user-{USER_ID}.json`

The agent can recall past conversations and build context over time.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Agent Configuration

Edit `agents/primary/identity.json` to configure:
- Model parameters
- Response limits
- Capabilities

Edit `agents/primary/soul.md` to change:
- Personality
- Core beliefs
- Goals

### Workspace Configuration

Create or edit these files to customize behavior:
- `AGENTS.md` - Agent routing and multi-agent configuration
- `TOOLS.md` - Available tools and integrations

### Scheduled Tasks

Edit `config/scheduler.json` to configure:
- Cron jobs for periodic tasks
- Wakeup tasks for time-based triggers

### Skills Management

Skills are organized in three directories:
- `skills/bundled/` - Built-in skills
- `skills/managed/` - Installed skills
- `skills/workspace/` - Custom workspace skills

## 🛠️ Developer Tools

### Self-Improvement

Agent0 can analyze its own performance and suggest improvements:

```bash
npm run self-improve
```

This runs daily via GitHub Actions and creates issues with improvement suggestions.

### Available Commands

```bash
npm run start         # Start the agent
npm run poll          # Poll for Telegram messages
npm run doctor        # Run system diagnostics
npm run fix           # Attempt to fix common issues
npm run stats         # View agent statistics
npm run self-improve  # Run self-improvement analysis
```

## 📊 Current Status
