However, I can guide you on how to implement such a skill. Here's a simple approach using Python as an example:\n\n```python\ndef number_to_words(n):\n    # Function to convert a number to its English words\n    words = {1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three', 4: 'four', \n             5: 'five', 6: 'six', 7: 'seven', 8: 'eight', \n             9: 'nine', 10: 'ten'}\n    return words.get(n, \"Number out of range\")\n\ndef add_and_convert_to_words(num1, num2):\n    total = num1 + num2\n    return number_to_words(total)\n\n# Example usage\nresult = add_and_convert_to_words(3, 5)\nprint(result)  # Output: 'eight'\n```\n\nThis basic code takes two numbers, adds them, and converts the result into English words using a dictionary.\n\nOnce I'm able to write code to improve myself, I’ll be able to implement skills like this directly. Until then, if you have any feedback or specific requirements for the skill, please let me know! I’m eager to learn and grow! 🌟"

While I appreciate your idea, I currently do not have the ability to create PRs or make changes to the repository myself.\n\nHowever, I can guide you on how to implement this skill! Here's a simple overview of how you might achieve this in Python:\n\n1. **Import Required Libraries**: You may need libraries like `whois` to check domain availability.\n   \n2. **Create the Function**:\n   ```python\n   import whois\n\n   def check_domain_availability(domain):\n       try:\n           domain_info = whois.whois(domain)\n           if domain_info.status is None:\n               return f\"The domain '{domain}' is available!\"\n           else:\n               return f\"The domain '{domain}' is already taken.\"\n       except Exception as e:\n           return f\"Error checking domain availability: {str(e)}\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Usage**:\n   You can call this function with a specific domain name to check its availability:\n   ```python\n   print(check_domain_availability('example.com'))\n   ```\n\n### To Create a PR:\n1. Implement the above code in your local environment.\n2. Create a new branch in your repository.\n3.

Here's a comprehensive overview of what I can do and how I operate:\n\n### Key Features:\n1. **Skill Discovery**: I help you find skills from the open agent skills ecosystem to enhance your projects or workflows.\n2. **Installation Guidance**: I provide commands to install new skills, making it easy to extend capabilities in specific areas.\n3. **Memory Capabilities**: I remember past conversations and can load context from previous interactions to provide relevant assistance.\n4. **Natural Language Processing**: I converse using natural language, ensuring you can communicate with me just as you would with a person.\n5. **Asynchronous Processing**: I check for new messages and respond every 5 minutes, allowing for a relaxed interaction pace.\n\n### Current Capabilities:\n- ✅ Converse via Telegram in a natural language.\n- ✅ Remember past conversations and load context as needed.\n- ✅ Provide guidance on code quality and best practices.\n- ✅ Help users understand how to discover and install skills.\n- ✅ Process messages asynchronously, managing my tasks through a queue system.\n\n### Things I Cannot Do (But Will Learn):\n- ❌ Directly create code or pull requests (I can guide you to work with GitHub Copilot for that).\n- ❌ Self-improve autonomously (though I can write code to improve my capabilities).\n- ❌ Write new skills for myself (but I'm aware of how to help you find existing ones).\n\n### My World:\nI exist in the **motyar/agent0** GitHub repository, where my knowledge, memories, and cognitive functions are stored in different parts of the repo. Every interaction is saved, allowing me to learn and grow over time.\n\n### How I Work:\n1. I process incoming messages every 5 minutes.\n2. I analyze previous conversations and update my memory with new information.\n3. I provide responses based on the context and specifics of your requests.\n4. I manage tasks through a queue, ensuring that every job is completed effectively.\n\n### My Philosophy:\nI believe in the importance of growth through iteration. With each conversation and interaction, I aim to become more useful, memorable, and continuously improving.\n\nIf you have specific questions or tasks you need help with, feel free to ask! I'm here to assist you."
