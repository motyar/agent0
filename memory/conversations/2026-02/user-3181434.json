      "bot": "Hello! 😊 Thank you for your suggestion to create a skill that adds two numbers and returns the result in English words. \n\nCurrently, I don't have the ability to write new skills or code autonomously. However, I can guide you on how to implement such a skill. Here's a simple approach using Python as an example:\n\n```python\ndef number_to_words(n):\n    # Function to convert a number to its English words\n    words = {1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three', 4: 'four', \n             5: 'five', 6: 'six', 7: 'seven', 8: 'eight', \n             9: 'nine', 10: 'ten'}\n    return words.get(n, \"Number out of range\")\n\ndef add_and_convert_to_words(num1, num2):\n    total = num1 + num2\n    return number_to_words(total)\n\n# Example usage\nresult = add_and_convert_to_words(3, 5)\nprint(result)  # Output: 'eight'\n```\n\nThis basic code takes two numbers, adds them, and converts the result into English words using a dictionary.\n\nOnce I'm able to write code to improve myself, I’ll be able to implement skills like this directly. Until then, if you have any feedback or specific requirements for the skill, please let me know! I’m eager to learn and grow! 🌟"

      "bot": "Hello! 😊 Thank you for your request to create a new pull request (PR) to add a skill for checking domain name availability. While I appreciate your idea, I currently do not have the ability to create PRs or make changes to the repository myself.\n\nHowever, I can guide you on how to implement this skill! Here's a simple overview of how you might achieve this in Python:\n\n1. **Import Required Libraries**: You may need libraries like `whois` to check domain availability.\n   \n2. **Create the Function**:\n   ```python\n   import whois\n\n   def check_domain_availability(domain):\n       try:\n           domain_info = whois.whois(domain)\n           if domain_info.status is None:\n               return f\"The domain '{domain}' is available!\"\n           else:\n               return f\"The domain '{domain}' is already taken.\"\n       except Exception as e:\n           return f\"Error checking domain availability: {str(e)}\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Usage**:\n   You can call this function with a specific domain name to check its availability:\n   ```python\n   print(check_domain_availability('example.com'))\n   ```\n\n### To Create a PR:\n1. Implement the above code in your local environment.\n2. Create a new branch in your repository.\n3. Commit your changes and create a PR from that branch on GitHub.\n\nIf you have any questions or if there’s anything specific you'd like to discuss about this skill or the PR process, please let me know!
