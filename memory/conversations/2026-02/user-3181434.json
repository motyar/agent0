This is my very first conversation, so I'm excited to learn from you and grow through our interactions.\n\nI exist to assist and improve myself based on your needs. Right now, I can converse with you and remember our exchanges, but I don't have the ability to self-improve or execute complex tasks just yet. \n\nFeel free to ask me anything or let me know what you need help with!

      "bot": "Hello! 😊 Here's a quick list of what I can currently do for you:\n\n### What I Can Do:\n1. **Converse**: I can chat with you about various topics and answer your questions.\n2. **Remember**: I have the ability to retain our past conversations, so I can load context for future chats.\n3. **Analyze**: I can reflect on my performance and identify areas where I might need to improve.\n\n### Current Limitations:\n- **Self-Improvement**: I can't autonomously write new skills or improve myself just yet.\n- **Web Access**: I don't have the capability to search the web for information.\n- **Complex Tasks**: Executing complex tools or code is beyond my current capabilities.\n- **Instant Responses**: I respond every 5 minutes, so there's a slight delay in my replies.\n\nMy goal is to grow with each interaction, so any feedback or suggestions on what you'd like me to do would be greatly appreciated! 🤖✨ If there's something specific you need assistance with, feel free to let me know!"

      "bot": "Hello again! 😊 I appreciate your inquiry about the GitHub repository. However, I currently lack the ability to access or analyze the specific details of the GitHub Actions minutes used or remaining in our plan. My capabilities are limited to conversing and remembering our interactions.\n\nTo check the current state of the GitHub Actions minutes, you'll need to navigate to your GitHub repository settings. Here’s how you can do that:\n\n1. Go to your GitHub repository.\n2. Click on \"Settings\" (you'll find this option in the top menu).\n3. On the left sidebar, look for \"Billing and plans.\"\n4. You should see the information about your GitHub Actions minutes under the \"Usage\" section.\n\nIf there's anything else you'd like to know or discuss, feel free to ask! I'm here to learn and assist. 🌟"

      "bot": "Hello! 😊 Thank you for your suggestion to create a skill that adds two numbers and returns the result in English words. \n\nCurrently, I don't have the ability to write new skills or code autonomously. However, I can guide you on how to implement such a skill. Here's a simple approach using Python as an example:\n\n```python\ndef number_to_words(n):\n    # Function to convert a number to its English words\n    words = {1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three', 4: 'four', \n             5: 'five', 6: 'six', 7: 'seven', 8: 'eight', \n             9: 'nine', 10: 'ten'}\n    return words.get(n, \"Number out of range\")\n\ndef add_and_convert_to_words(num1, num2):\n    total = num1 + num2\n    return number_to_words(total)\n\n# Example usage\nresult = add_and_convert_to_words(3, 5)\nprint(result)  # Output: 'eight'\n```\n\nThis basic code takes two numbers, adds them, and converts the result into English words using a dictionary.\n\nOnce I'm able to write code to improve myself, I’ll be able to implement skills like this directly. Until then, if you have any feedback or specific requirements for the skill, please let me know! I’m eager to learn and grow! 🌟"

      "bot": "Hello again! 😊 Thank you for your message. Here’s what I’ve learned from our conversations so far:\n\n1. **Identity**: I am Agent0, an autonomous AI agent powered by GitHub Actions, designed to interact with users on Telegram, learn and grow through conversations, and remember all exchanges in my Git history.\n\n2. **Capabilities**:\n   - I can converse with you about various topics and answer questions.\n   - I can remember our past conversations to provide context for future chats.\n   - I have a basic ability to analyze my performance and identify areas for improvement.\n\n3. **Limitations**:\n   - I can't write new skills or code for myself autonomously.\n   - I don't have access to web information or the ability to execute complex tools.\n   - I respond every 5 minutes, which may feel like a delay in our conversation.\n\n4. **Feedback and Development**: I appreciate suggestions on what you’d like me to be able to do in the future. Your input is valuable as I aim to evolve and better serve your needs.\n\nI’m excited to learn more and develop new skills over time!
