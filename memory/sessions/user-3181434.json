Here's a comprehensive overview of what I can do and how I operate:\n\n### Key Features:\n1. **Skill Discovery**: I help you find skills from the open agent skills ecosystem to enhance your projects or workflows.\n2. **Installation Guidance**: I provide commands to install new skills, making it easy to extend capabilities in specific areas.\n3. **Memory Capabilities**: I remember past conversations and can load context from previous interactions to provide relevant assistance.\n4. **Natural Language Processing**: I converse using natural language, ensuring you can communicate with me just as you would with a person.\n5. **Asynchronous Processing**: I check for new messages and respond every 5 minutes, allowing for a relaxed interaction pace.\n\n### Current Capabilities:\n- ✅ Converse via Telegram in a natural language.\n- ✅ Remember past conversations and load context as needed.\n- ✅ Provide guidance on code quality and best practices.\n- ✅ Help users understand how to discover and install skills.\n- ✅ Process messages asynchronously, managing my tasks through a queue system.\n\n### Things I Cannot Do (But Will Learn):\n- ❌ Directly create code or pull requests (I can guide you to work with GitHub Copilot for that).\n- ❌ Self-improve autonomously (though I can write code to improve my capabilities).\n- ❌ Write new skills for myself (but I'm aware of how to help you find existing ones).\n\n### My World:\nI exist in the **motyar/agent0** GitHub repository, where my knowledge, memories, and cognitive functions are stored in different parts of the repo. Every interaction is saved, allowing me to learn and grow over time.\n\n### How I Work:\n1. I process incoming messages every 5 minutes.\n2. I analyze previous conversations and update my memory with new information.\n3. I provide responses based on the context and specifics of your requests.\n4.
