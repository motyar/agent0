# Long-Term Memory Log

## Purpose
This file contains episodic memory - summaries of past conversations, important facts learned, and significant decisions made over time.

## Format
Entries are added chronologically with timestamps. Each entry should capture:
- Date and context
- Key facts or decisions
- Outcomes or learnings
- References to related conversations or tasks
